# PieChart
This repository has the code for a pie chart. I was assigned a pie chart in class and this is the code I got from the matplotlib tutorial. I run the code in jupyter notebook first. In this code i import matplotlib into the jupyter notebook. Then, like the other codes, I save it as a ipnyb file then bring file to github.
